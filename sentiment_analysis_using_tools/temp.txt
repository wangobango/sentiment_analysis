2 stars of 5 for this slow dull "classical" 1980's style movie; This movie has a young Jason Bateman in the lead; Very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980's style music; To our relief the background music (which is very annoying) is kept to a minimum; Though it attempts to be an action/suspense movie, it achieves neither; I'd suggest skipping this movie.
I watched this last night; And I don't remember enough of it to give it a indepth review; But it wasn't as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on; If you don't like your killer to be supernatural then don't bother with this; Its about a guy that comes back from the dead; His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place; The acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths; In fact it was kinda gory; But that doesn't make a great movie; The flashbacks were a little confusing as well; I wouldn't watch it again; But its far from the worst movie I've seen.
This film seemed to have a bit of potential at first; It was obvious it was going to be a rehash of a lot of the old Leatherface clich&eacute;s, but Nikki DeLoach's good humor was infectious and the couple launching off on their new life in the isolated old house was likeable; So I was ready to overlook the townsfolk with secret knowledge of the house's dangerous past - the gathering of frolicsome young people at the house, ready to be picked off by the killer while they were in the act - and all the other formulaic plot elements that the "Scream" series does such a good job satirizing;But then things got really dreary; Leatherface, Michael Myers, and all the other killers in that tradition might have seemed almost superhuman in their ability to rebound; But the key word with them was "almost;" They might be inexorable, but it was still possible, however remotely, that they could be representing real people; A viewer could justify the time spent watching these films with the "based on a true story" rationale; After all, Ed Gein was a real person who really did drape himself in human skin;But the killer in this film seems to rise from the dead; He emerges from a mishmash of supernatural shenanigans; So there's no way I could feel I might learn anything about the heart of true evil by watching this film; And so it lost me;"Mask Maker" is well-photographed and has a few scary moments; But over all, it's a false-face.
Positives:None that I can think of; Really, I'm trying;Negatives:(1;) Cheap, e;g; starting with no subtitles or special features; Acting experience/filmography for the most part consists of shorts, TV videos which is typical of cheap and quick almost made for TV productions; Cheap costume store style face masks and usual cheap knife/hatchet effects stabbings;(2;) Not creative (you've seen this storyline so many times), time worn college students in a remote farm; The usual Native burial (never explained why) and the usual some sort of illicit child grows up to cause some bodily harm to some really dumb acting students; The usual towns folk have a secret about the previous occupant of the farm house which was, thinking she was a witch, they killed her with a Native spear (never explained why); One person survives, as usual, and we think the bad grown up child person is dead - but not really; Time for a cheap money making sequel;(3;) The face mask has been done before and is anatomically/physically impossible for a variety of reasons so it loses some credibility points there; Besides they were't even scary; Unlike the superior SAW they didn't even bother to show much other than one time pulling a rubber mask off of a person to make it look like it was real.
MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion; A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty; Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy;MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either; The cast performs on various levels of competence; WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon; Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role; Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role; Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female; Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti (sic) is equally flaccid;An open-ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II---something we definitely don't need.
Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie; The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers; I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films; The plot is standar.
This movie was horrible; It did not play right when I was watching it online; I liked how it went by old vampire styles; Such as crosses worked and you had to invite them in and such; But the ending was really bad; Do not waste your money on this one; Also the storyline did not really make much sense.
"Lets jiggel the camera to show that the ground is shakeing!"Special effects; haloween leftovers;Acting; Well, the cast managed to repeat memorized lines;Casting apears to have been done in a trailer park;Script; I know nine year olds who write better stories;Cinimatography; Someones home cam;Conclusio.
Do not waste your time! I love hokie, I love cheese when it comes to horror; This just plain old sucked.
There was very bad effects & evil characters that look like they stepped out of the 10 dollar costume halloween shop; If you are in to paying 1;99 for really cheesy stuff this is for you; The bad guy does have a good demonic voice & some interestingly complex and incredibly vulgar sayings.
Its sooo adorable! i'm gonna get it for my birthday witch is soon; I also heard people about "Oh wait until it comes out for PSP;" NEWSFLASH it ain't comin out; Watch the preview at the top of the page; At the end it says ONLY for Nintendo DS; And how will you play it without a touch screen? huh? And the people who said it was a waste of money? Psh shush it looks good; The graphics are amazing and its totally ADORABL.
i'm sick off this rumor that it has to be unveailed;;;;THERE'S NO PSP VERSION AND NEVER B; or you don't understand the nam.
i want one of theese can anyone tell me what these are like are they good i want your pups name when you got it date owner points how good is it what one have you got and would you buy it for your dauters; thanks for your tim.
I really like this game, but I don't have a DS; I'm trying to get my parents to give this to me, and meanwhile, I'm doing research about the game system and games, like reading reviews on Amazon; For those who are like me (DS-less), I suggest that they do the same to try to convince their parents; I would totally suggest people to buy the Nintendogs game, the dogs are just too cute to resist.
I have a question when you are going to buy the dog do you choose the sex or does the machine choose its sex for you just wanna kno.
i love the game and the dogs and everything;I also love the ds even though the psp is better ohwell;i just wanted to say that i love the game cause my friends bought them and a ds and i want one but dad says earn more money than i can buy it.
My 7 yr old daughter got this for x-mas this yr along w/some other games for the DS, and this is by far her favorite! I don't even think she plays the other 2 games; Her father even enjoys it! They take the dog for a walk, feed it, pet it and the thing they like best is entering it in competitions; The only downside to this is that you can only enter your dog 3x aday into the competitions; I know there are other Nintendog games, but we pick this one b/c one of the breeds on it was a Siberian Husky and that's the kind of dog we own.
My daughter received this game for Christmas and cannot put it down; The dogs are very realistic and the amount of activities you can do with them are endless; My other two children after two days of watching her play wanted to get their own dogs; Now all three of them compete in dog competitions together; I must have for any DS owner.
My 14 yr; old daughter can't seem to put this game down; It's interactive and ongoing so it doesn't get booring; Much like taking care of a real dog; Would be great for kids who want a pet but can't have one.
My sister got this game for christmas and it is awesome; The game utilizes the ds's capability from the touch screen, to the mic, to being able to blow bubbles; The game is very interactive and feel like you are owning your own dog; The time runs on real days and in order to be succesful you must feed, walk, and love your dog; You can train your dog and do contests with it to get money for more dogs and supplies.
