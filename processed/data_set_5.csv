B000F3UA8E-A2I4VTPKGSQZ75-1245196800-2521;In ` Cemetery Man ' , better known Europe ` Dellamorte Dellamore ' , poor old Rupert Everett ( famous ) , deal pesky plague corps return life seventh night burial graveyard small `` Italian '' town Buffalora . Although n't single word Italian spoken film , apart word `` Dellamorte '' & `` Dellamore '' , Italian setting unmistakable . At first , premise sound great . It promised return ( least nod ) good old day 70 's Italian gore classic , like ` Zombie Flesh Eaters ' ` Zombie Creeping Flesh ' , unfortunately , first 25 minute , descends mish-mash unintelligible aimless.Honestly , I understand movie would decent following , film really n't know direction 's going . It continually wanders blind alley get lost . Even basic premise film hung never fully fleshed ... speak completely abandoned half way running time . Likewise , side story Everett 's hopeless infatuation several woman ( Anna Falchi ) never seems know therefore one left unsatisfying taste mouth , end credit roll.Unfortunately , film 's character n't save day either . Everett come across annoying foppish Englishman ( totally place Italian setting ) , inbuilt detachment whole project . Falchi , course striking , could n't act way paper bag every character make number seems . Except Everett 's monosyllabic friend work colleague Gnaghi , 's played greatly Francois Hadji-Lazaro easily best thing movie. '' Gna ! `` But , ` Cemetery Man ' fails deliver promise , hold certain spell viewer . It 's atmosphere without merit fact 's far interesting movie large percentage dross get green light every year way , aimlessness one charm , truly never know film going go next . The problem though , get feeling director Michele Soavi n't 100 % sure either . I n't read book film based , I 'd wager number departure novel 's narrative . Either way film veers superbly weird ` Mr. Vampire ' like atmosphere one minute , absurd , inane extremely annoying idiocy next.It also difficult know Soavi thrusting picture . As bizarre pudding zombie horror , comedy , romance & eurotrash , film promise everything one hand delivers nothing . Simply none theme expanded discarded willy-nilly . The zombie far ( completely forgotten ) , comedy funny , romance chemistry aborted time eurotrash trashy enough. ` Cemetery Man ' , way , complete failure though due largely previously mentioned atmosphere I 'd recommend ( Gnaghi ) alone . But certainly stable weird euro horror 1970 's / 80 's sure disappoint many come angle.Either way , 's probably movie I revisit sometime future , I 'll almost surely come away feeling way . Confused , unsatisfied little short changed .;0

B000F3UA8E-unknown-1017878400-2523;movie boring tripe . except sex scene graveyard . Still tripe boring . let say two become three . Somewhat humourous . This film better average budget movie genre wasted ! Its scary , gory entertaining . Did mention B.O.R.I.N.G ? Overall , found film overated . say ? n't believe hype .;0
B000F3UA8E-A1L3RWD0VD0A1P-1097452800-2524;Cemetery Man looked promising . Rupert Everette star cemetery curator problem -- resident undead nasty habit returning pseudo-life couple week interment . But Rupert profound aversion paperwork shoot head buries ... day one true love ( italian model bear startling resemblence Star Trek 's `` Seven-Of-Nine '' ) dy unfortunate zombie accident.What I say ? We bored . We took plunge , flashed fatal Blockbuster card , irretrievably lost two hour life countless innocent brain cell flick . Oh know 're thinking -- camp , zombie , gorgeous gay Englishmen ... 's like ? Well , I 'll tell ya;0
